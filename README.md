# Crystal-Collector-Game
Each gem has a hidden value.  Using these gems, the goal of the game is to match the magic total coming out of the lamp EXACTLY. 
If the user exceeds the magic total, they lose the game and the next round begins. 
This was my first attempt at using JQUERY instead of vanilla javascript.

I really like the style behind this project.
